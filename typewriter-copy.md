Hi. I'm *still* working in “computers” until I decide what I want to do in life.
I wasn't around for the space race, but I was around for the world wide web.
I waited about a minute to see a photo of the Space Shuttle stack pulled from NASA's public FTP server.
I had yellow pages for the Web.
I read Cliff's notes before dummies.
I went social in the "The" era.
My boss trusted me to get on a plane with no build when demoing our software to Tim Cook. We sent the build at 5am.
